## Unfinished tasks (with notes)
- Login/ Registration authentication
    Giecel tried to attempt the authentication but there was some errors possibly due to the firbase 
    and supabase being in the app at the same time. 

- In the process of styling the list page
    started working on it 06/18/25 but should not take long 

- Still need to add styling for search page and feed page
    styling should be the same for all pages

- Reminder button
    add functionality

- Adding the feed screen
    instead of the trending page we decided to go with the feed page 

- Testing app
    need to work on some testing

## Bugs or Blockers
- install react-native-share bug
